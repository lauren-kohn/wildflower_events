# WildflowerEvents

Welcome to Wildflower Events, a gem that will help you search for events at the University of Texas Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center outside of Austin, Texas. Founded in 1982, the Wildflower Center is dedicated to the conservation of native plants. To this end, they provide many opportunities for nature appreciation, plant conservation and ecological research and design.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'wildflower_events'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install wildflower_events

## Usage

To run the program, enter ./bin/find_events. When prompted, type a desired search term and press enter. If there are no results, users can enter a different search term. The program will then present a list of events presented by the www.Wildflower.org website. Select one from the list by entering a number; this will present the date and cost of the activity. The search can then be repeated as desired by following the prompts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
